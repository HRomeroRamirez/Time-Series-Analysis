# Just-For-Fun Projects: Forecasting EAI

This repository contains R code to perform time series analysis and forecasting of the Puerto Rico Economic Activity Index (EAI) from January 1980 to February 2025. The analysis includes unit root tests (Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Phillips-Perron) to check for stationarity, followed by estimating an ARIMA model to forecast the EAI for the next 12 months.

# Description

Unit Root Tests: Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron (PP) tests are performed to determine if the time series is stationary.
Modeling: An ARIMA model is estimated to capture the dynamics of the EAI.
Forecasting: The model produces a 12-month forecast of the Economic Activity Index.
Time Period Covered: January 1980 to February 2025 (historical data).
